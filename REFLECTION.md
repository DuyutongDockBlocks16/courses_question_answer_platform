# Project Reflection Document

## Project Strengths

1. **Aesthetic User Interface**  
   This project leverages many native components from Flowbite-Svelte, resulting in a visually appealing design and a pleasant user experience. The smooth interactions and modern interface enhance user satisfaction and ensure usability across different devices.

2. **Efficient API Implementation**  
   The project effectively utilizes the capabilities of the database for API implementations, allowing many complex query operations to be executed at the database level. This design not only improves data processing efficiency but also reduces the load on the backend, enabling it to focus on other critical business logic.

3. **Scientific Caching Strategy**  
   A scientific caching strategy is employed in the project, with separate caching for courses, questions, and answers. This approach effectively reduces the frequency of flushes and minimizes the pressure on the database, resulting in faster response times and a smoother information retrieval experience for users.

4. **Rate Limiting for User Submissions**  
   To prevent users from submitting questions and answers too frequently, the project implements a rate limit of once per minute. This design helps reduce server load and enhances system stability, preventing the generation of spam content.

5. **Kubernetes Configuration**  
   The project includes Kubernetes configuration, enabling easy containerized deployment and management. This configuration enhances the application's scalability and maintainability, allowing it to adapt to future changes in requirements.

## Project Weaknesses

Despite the project's strengths, there are some shortcomings. The use of native components has led to the limitation of not supporting infinite scrolling, which prevents the implementation of loading only 20 entries per page. This limitation affects the convenience of users when browsing large amounts of data, potentially resulting in a less favorable experience.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project excels in design and implementation, effectively leveraging existing technologies to enhance user experience and system efficiency. However, there are still areas for improvement regarding existing weaknesses, which should be addressed in future iterations. Consideration can be given to integrating alternative technical solutions to resolve the infinite scrolling issue while maintaining system stability and enhancing user convenience in data browsing.
